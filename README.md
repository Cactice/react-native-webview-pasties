# react-native-webview-pasties
This is for adding components that move along with the webview.

# Why is this cool?
It allows you to make incremental migration from web app to React Native app.
The migration will go smoothly when you have a state management.
All you need to do at that point is to send store to the native side with postMessage() and you can start migrating other logics and converting components for mobile platform

# Current state of development
No npm package has been published yet but I'm working on releasing it.
